The home page displays a list of all questions with links to take the user to that specific question page. 
The questions page displays the full text of the question, as well as the tags and likes for that question.
Also displayed are all answers for that question. 
Logged in users see a Like button which allows them to like a question once and and post post answers to the question. 
Logged in users can also ask a question via a link on the navbar. 

This project uses AJAX, Entity Framework, a login system, and many to many relationships.
